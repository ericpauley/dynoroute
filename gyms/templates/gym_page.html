						<div class="portlet-content">
							<p>
								Gainesville Rock Gym came to life January 1, 2000. GRG’s first goal in opening has remained its guiding principle for over a decade now, to provide the greatest recreational experience in North Florida. GRG was purchased by Climb Gainesville Inc. in March 2013 and continues to uphold the same mission.
							</p>
							<p>
								The gym’s mission has meant a lot of things to a lot of people over the years; GRG has been a unique experience for recreational thrill-seekers as well as a home to athletes who have adopted the climbing lifestyle and have reshaped the trajectory of their lives because of it.
							</p>
							<p>
								We are excited to use Dynoroute to provide our climbers with an up to date interface of our current routes!
